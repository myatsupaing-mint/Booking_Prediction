# British Airways Virtual Internship: Flight Booking Prediction ‚úàÔ∏è  

This project is part of the **British Airways Virtual Internship on Forage**, focusing on predicting whether a customer will complete a flight booking. The analysis involves **data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and evaluation** to uncover key insights and improve predictive accuracy.  

## üìå Project Overview  
### Goals  
- Analyze booking-related factors to predict flight booking completion.  
- Develop a machine learning model to classify customers based on their likelihood to complete a booking.   

## üìä Dataset & Features  
The dataset includes various booking attributes, such as:  
- **Purchase Lead**: Days between booking and flight departure.  
- **Length of Stay**: Duration of stay at the destination.  
- **Flight Hour**: Time of flight departure.  
- **Additional Preferences**: Extra baggage requests, preferred cabin class, etc.  

## üîç Project Workflow  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing  
- **Encoded categorical variables** using one-hot encoding.  
- **Split dataset** into training and testing sets for model evaluation.  


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model  
- **Implemented a Random Forest Classifier** to predict booking completion.  
- **Achieved 85.36% accuracy** on the test set.  
- **Evaluated model performance** using classification reports and confusion matrices.  


## üõ† Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - Data Processing: Pandas
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  
  - Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, recall, f1-score
